Spring Rest - Resource Design

-> the resource should be always be plural nouns and the API endpoints adn if one instance reasource shouldl be
 retrieved, pass the id in the URL
    -> GET /accounts
    -> GET /accounts/1
    -> DELETE /accounts/2

-> In case of nested resources (resources under a resource), the resources should be accessible as follows.
    -> GET /accounts/1/payments/45

-> Use the HTTP methods (aka "verbs") to specify what to do with this resource. With
    methods GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE you can provide CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
