The Factory Method Pattern is another creational design pattern that provides an
interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the
type of objects that will be created.

What is the Factory Method Pattern?
The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses
decide which class to instantiate. It promotes loose coupling by decoupling the
client code from the concrete classes it uses for object creation.
