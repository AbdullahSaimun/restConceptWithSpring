Singleton Design Pattern

The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global access point to that instance. It's a creational pattern that controls object creation.

Key Characteristics:

Single Instance: Only one object of the class can exist.
Global Access Point: A static method provides a way to retrieve the single instance.
Private Constructor: Prevents direct instantiation from outside the class.
Benefits:

Enforces a single instance for classes representing global resources like configurations, loggers, or database connections.
Provides a controlled way to access the single instance.
Can improve performance by avoiding redundant object creation.
Drawbacks:

Tight coupling (reliance on static methods), making testing trickier.
Can introduce inflexibility if multiple instances are needed later.
